Given the array of positive integers and the integer n, find whether there is a range of length at least 1, sum of the array's elements in which is equal to the given number.

Example:
findRange([1,2,3,4,5], 7) = true,
since the sum of the elements in range [2, 3] is array([2, 3]) = 3 + 4 = 7

[input] array.integer array

0 ≤ |array| ≤ 2000.
[input] integer n

[output] boolean

true if such a range exists, false otherwise.
