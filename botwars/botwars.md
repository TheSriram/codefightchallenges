Two bots A and B are fighting for the memory card. Both bots are pupils of "Optimus Prime", and they are very clever. After the exhausting fight, B told A that it would give the memory card if A answered a difficult question.

B asked A to find the number of ways to represent the given even number n as the sum of two prime numbers. Help A to get the memory card.

Example:

botWar(8) = 1
The only solution is 8 = 5 + 3.

botWar(10) = 2
There are two solutions: 10 = 3 + 7 and 10 = 5 + 5.

[input] integer n

Some even number, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
[output] integer
