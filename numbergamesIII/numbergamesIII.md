You're given an array S of positive integers.

Return number x from S, such that each number of S is a multiple of x, or -1 if such x doesn't exist.

Examples:

NumberGameIII([3,6,3,15,9]) = 3
Each number of S is a multiple of 3, and 3 belongs to S, so the answer is 3.

NumberGameIII([4,7]) = -1
7 is not a multiple of 4.
4 is not a multiple of 7.
So the answer is -1.

[input] array.integer S
